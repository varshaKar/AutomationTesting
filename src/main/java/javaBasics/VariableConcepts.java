        //Variable : Temporary storage of data/values

        //Why Variables are having temporary storage, because it's scope of execution
        //is during the execution time of the program

        //Once the execution is completed then all the variables will be vanished or erased off in JVM

        //Rules to followed for declaring a variable name:
        //1. It should always start with a small letter
        //2. It should not start with numbers or any special characters
        //3. Variable names should not have any white spaces between them, (we can underscore(_) symbol instead of a whitespace.
        //4. Variable Names should not have any JAVA Keywords

        //JAVA is a statically typed language --> We need to mention the data type explicitly
        //Along with JAVA, C#, TypeScript

        //Python, JS are dynamically typed language --> We need not mention any data type to store the values

        //Different Types of data types:
        //1. Primitive Data Type: int, char, boolean, byte, short, long, float, double
        //2. Non Primitive Data Type: String, Arrays, List, etc...............................................
